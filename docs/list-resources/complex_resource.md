# tfcoremock_complex_resource (List Resource)

A complex resource that contains five basic attributes, four complex attributes, and two nested blocks.

The five basic attributes are `boolean`, `number`, `string`, `float`, and `integer` (as with the `tfcoremock_simple_resource`).

The complex attributes are a `map`, a `list`, a `set`, and an `object`. The `object` type contains the same set of attributes as the schema itself, making a recursive structure. The `list`, `set` and `map` all contain objects which are also recursive. Blocks cannot go into attributes, so the complex attributes do not recurse on the block types.

The blocks are a nested `list_block` and a nested `set_block`. The blocks contain the same set of attributes and blocks as the schema itself, also making a recursive structure. Note, blocks contain both attributes and more blocks so the block types are fully recursive.

The complex and block types are nested 3 times, at the leaf level of recursion the complex attributes and blocks only contain the simple (ie. non-recursive) attributes. This prevents a potentially infinite level of recursion.
