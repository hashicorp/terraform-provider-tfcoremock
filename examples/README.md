# Examples

This directory contains examples that are mostly used for documentation, but can
also be run/tested manually via the Terraform CLI.

The examples held in the `data-sources`, `resources`, `actions`, and `providers`
directories are used in the automatic documentation generation process.

The examples held in the `dynamic-resources` directory are slightly more
interesting and contain examples of generating different types of resources
dynamically.
